# 3DVehicleDetection

### Introduction
The main purpose of this repository is to provide an unofficial implementation of the 3D vehicle detection framework discussed in "3D Bounding Box Estimation Using Deep Learning and Geometry". You can access the paper [here](url).

We also look into the 2D detection part, train our own model with Tensorflow Object Detection API, and test it together with the rest of the framework.

I tried my best to make this into a complete tutorial, rather than a sole implementation. I hope you find what you are looking for without getting too bored.

This repository also contains an organized notebook that you can run cell-by-cell on Google Colab without worrying about anything (not even the dataset).
